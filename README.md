# 🧹 MySQL Data Cleaning Project
This repository houses a comprehensive data cleaning project focused on transforming raw, messy datasets into clean, usable formats using MySQL.

# ✨ Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate robust data cleaning techniques within a MySQL environment, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and readiness for analysis or further application.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
MySQL: For all data manipulation, querying, and cleaning operations.

SQL Workbench/CLI: For executing SQL scripts and interacting with the database.

# 🚀 Getting Started

Import the initial dataset: - <a href="https://github.com/AritroPaul23/Data_Analysis_Dashboard/blob/main/BlinkIT%20Grocery%20Data_Analysis.xlsx">Dataset</a>

Execute cleaning scripts: Navigate to the sql/ directory and run the cleaning scripts in the specified order (if applicable).

🗃️ Data Cleaning Steps (Example)
Handling Missing Values: Identification and imputation/removal of NULL or empty entries.

Duplicate Removal: Eliminating redundant records.

Data Type Correction: Ensuring columns have appropriate data types.

Standardization & Formatting: Unifying inconsistent data entries (e.g., date formats, text casing).

Outlier Detection & Treatment: Identifying and addressing unusual data points.

📊 Cleaned Data
The cleaned_data/ directory (or a designated database schema/table) will contain the final, processed dataset ready for use.
