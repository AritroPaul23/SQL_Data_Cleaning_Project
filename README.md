# üßπ MySQL Data Cleaning Project
This repository houses a comprehensive data cleaning project focused on transforming raw, messy datasets into clean, usable formats using MySQL.

# ‚ú® Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate robust data cleaning techniques within a MySQL environment, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and readiness for analysis or further application.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
MySQL: For all data manipulation, querying, and cleaning operations.

SQL Workbench/CLI: For executing SQL scripts and interacting with the database.

# üöÄ Getting Started

Import the initial dataset: - <a href="https://github.com/AritroPaul23/SQL_Data_Cleaning_Project/blob/main/layoffs.csv">Dataset</a>

Execute cleaning scripts: Navigate to the sql/ directory and run the cleaning scripts in the specified order (if applicable).

# üóÉÔ∏è Data Cleaning Steps (Example)
## Handling Missing Values: Identification and imputation/removal of NULL or empty entries.

## Duplicate Removal: Eliminating redundant records.

```sql
/* Now we are going to make a lot changes in the raw data so if we make some mistake in the process we should have the raw data to go back.
So we will create another table with the same column, structure and record like layoffs*/


CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging   -- Table Creation: MySQL create a new table named layoffs_staging
SELECT * FROM layoffs          -- Schema Copying: The new layoffs_staging table will inherit the same column names and data types as the layoffs table. It essentially clones the structure of layoffs.
WHERE 1 = 1;                   -- Data Copying: All rows from the layoffs table will be copied into the newly created layoffs_staging table. The WHERE 1=1 clause is a condition that is always true.

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging;
```

## Data Type Correction: Ensuring columns have appropriate data types.

## Standardization & Formatting: Unifying inconsistent data entries (e.g., date formats, text casing).

## Outlier Detection & Treatment: Identifying and addressing unusual data points.

# üìä Cleaned Data
The cleaned_data/ directory (or a designated database schema/table) will contain the final, processed dataset ready for use.
